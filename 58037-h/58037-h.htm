<h2><span>PREFACE.</span></h2>
<p>Stephen Hawes, the author of the following
poem, was, according to the information gathered
by Warton, a native of Suffolk, and studied in
the University of Oxford, after which he travelled
much in France, and &ldquo;became a complete master
of the French and Italian poetry.&rdquo; He subsequently
obtained the favour of King Henry VII,
who made him groom of his privy chamber. To
Warton&rsquo;s information, we are at present able only
to add, that it appears from a book of the expenses
of the 12th Henry VIII, among the records in the
Rolls House, that the following payment was made
to our author on the 6th of January in that year:
the play referred to is now perhaps lost.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&ldquo;Item, to Mr. Hawse, for his play, vj<sup>li.</sup> xiij<sup>s.</sup> iiij<sup>d.</sup>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Hawes was the author of several other works
besides the one here printed, for an account of
which we refer the reader to &ldquo;Warton&rsquo;s History
of English Poetry.&rdquo; They are in general of very
little importance. &ldquo;The Pastime of Pleasure,&rdquo;
which Warton characterises as his &ldquo;capital work,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
is one of those allegorical writings which were
popular with our forefathers, but which can now
only be looked upon as monuments of the bad
taste of a bad age. It is however a monument;
and being one of the most remarkable productions
between the age of Lydgate and that of Wyatt
and Surrey, it deserves to be reprinted as one of
the links in the history of English poetry, without
which that history would be incomplete. The old
editions of this poem are very rare.</p>
<p>The present edition is a reprint of that of 1555,
of which there is a copy in the British Museum.
In two passages the language is so gross in the
original, that it has been considered necessary to
omit a few lines. These relate chiefly to the
<i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of a tale which was extremely popular
in the Middle Ages, and which will be found
told with somewhat more decency in the common
chap-book story of the enchanter Virgil. It has
been thought sufficient to print the simple text of
this poem, without illustrative notes. From the
nature of the work, the choice lay between giving
a large mass of explanatory matter, or none at all,
and the circumstances under which it has been
published placed the former alternative entirely
out of the question.</p>

<p class="t0">Was not Aristotle for all his clergy,</p>

<p class="t0">Nay, nay, quod he, with all my whole entente,</p>

<p class="t0">Well then, quod she, I shall you nowe tell</p>
<p class="t0">Howe the case standeth, truely, every dele:</p>
<p class="t0">For you knowe well that some women do long</p>
<p class="t0">After nyce thynges, be it ryght or wrong.</p>
<p class="t0">Ryght so must I upon your backe nowe ryde,</p>
<p class="t0">In your mouthe also a brydle you to guyde.</p>
<p class="t0">And so a brydle she put in his mouthe,</p>
<p class="t0">Upon his backe she rode both north and south,</p>
<p class="t0">About a chamber as some clarkes wene,</p>
<p class="t0">Of many persones it was openly sene!</p>
<p class="t0">Lo! what is love, that can so sore blynde</p>
<p class="t0">A philosopher to bryng hym out of kynde?</p>
<p class="t0">For love doth passe any maner of thyng,</p>
<p class="t0">It is harde and privy in workyng.</p>
<p class="t0">So on the grounde Aristotle crept,</p>
<p class="t0">And in his teeth she long the brydle kept,</p>
<p class="t0">Till she therof had inough her fyll;</p>
<p class="t0">And yet for this he never had his wyll.</p>
<p class="t0">She dyd nothing but for to mocke and scorne</p>
<p class="t0">This true lover whiche was for love forlorne:</p>
<p class="t0">But when he knewe the poynt of the case,</p>
<p class="t0">The fyry angre dyde hys herte enbrace,</p>
<p class="t0">That he him selfe dyd anone well knowe,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p class="t0">His angre dyd his love so overthrowe,</p>
<p class="t0">And ryght anone, as some poets wryte,</p>
<p class="t0">He the gret mockage dyd her well acquyte.</p>
<p class="t0">Dyd not a woman the famouse Vyrgyle</p>
<p class="t0">By her greate fraude full craftely begyle?</p>
<p class="t0">For on a day, for hys owne dysporte,</p>
<p class="t0">To the court of Rome he gan to resorte,</p>
<p class="t0">Amonge the ladyes the tyme for to passe;</p>
<p class="t0">Tyl at the last, lyke Phebus in the glasse,</p>
<p class="t0">So dyd a lady wyth her beaute clere</p>
<p class="t0">Shyne throughe his hert wyth suche love so dere,</p>
<p class="t0">That of great force he must nedes obey,</p>
<p class="t0">She of his mynde bare bothe the locke and the kay:</p>
<p class="t0">So was his hart set upon a fyre</p>
<p class="t0">Wyth fervent love to attayne hys desyre.</p>
<p class="t0">She had him caught in suche a wyly snare,</p>
<p class="t0">Great was his payne and muche more his care,</p>
<p class="t0">To fynde a tyme whan it should be meved</p>
<p class="t0">To her of love and he nothynge repreved.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus every day, by ymagynacyon,</p>
<p class="t0">In his mynde was suche perturbacyon,</p>
<p class="t0">And at the last he had found a tyme</p>
<p class="t0">Hym thought to speke, and unto hym no cryme.</p>
<p class="t0">Mercy! lady, nowe, in all humble wyse,</p>
<p class="t0">To her he sayd: for yf ye me dyspyse</p>
<p class="t0">So hath your beaute my true hart aryed,</p>
<p class="t0">It is no mervayle thoughe I be afrayde</p>
<p class="t0">To you to speake it, that you deny</p>

<p class="t0">Wyth inwarde care I by your beauty dere,</p>

<p class="t0">Of your trouble, and of your great disease;</p>
<p class="t0">But I wote not howe that it should be,</p>
<p class="t0">Without tournynge us to great dyshoneste;</p>
<p class="t0">If it be knowen, than bothe you and I</p>
<p class="t0">Shall be reheited at full shamefully.</p>
<p class="t0">But what for that? I have me bethought</p>
<p class="t0">A praty craft by me shalbe wrought.</p>
<p class="t0">Ye knowe my chambre joyneth to a wall,</p>
<p class="t0">Beynge right hyghe and a wyndowe wythall.</p>
<p class="t0">Soone at nyght, when all folke be at reast.</p>
<p class="t0">I shall take a basket as me thynketh beast,</p>
<p class="t0">And therto I shall a longe corde well tye,</p>
<p class="t0">And from the wyndowe let it downe pryvely.</p>
<p class="t0">Right so, whan it is downe on the grounde,</p>
<p class="t0">Ye may well entre in it, both hole and sound,</p>
<p class="t0">And my two maydens the whiche secrete be</p>
<p class="t0">Shall anone helpe to hale you up with me.</p>
<p class="t0">Lo! in this wyse you may have ryght well</p>
<p class="t0">Your owne desyre in short space every deel.</p>
<p class="t0">At xi. of the clocke, in the nyght so darke,</p>
<p class="t0">They did appoynt for to fulfyll this worke.</p>
<p class="t0">He often thanked her gentlines,</p>
<p class="t0">And so departed with great gladnes;</p>
<p class="t0">And so he went unto his study,</p>
<p class="t0">Passyng the tyme himselfe full merely,</p>
<p class="t0">Tyll that the clocke did strike aleven,</p>
<p class="t0">Then to the wall he went full even,</p>
<p class="t0">And founde the basket at the grounde already,</p>
<p class="t0">And entred into it full sodaynly,</p>
<p class="t0">Waggyng the rope, which the lady espied,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p class="t0">Whiche to the wyndowe ryght anone her hyed.</p>
<p class="t0">With her two maydens she did him up wynde,</p>
<p class="t0">Amiddes the wall, and left hym there behynde,</p>
<p class="t0">That was fyve fadom and more from the grounde.</p>
<p class="t0">When him selfe in suche a case he founde,</p>
<p class="t0">Alas! he sayde, myne owne lady, save</p>
<p class="t0">Myne honestye, and what ye list to have,</p>
<p class="t0">Ye shall have it at your owne desire.</p>
<p class="t0">Nowe wynde me up, my hart is on fyre.</p>
<p class="t0">Thou shalt, quod she, in that place abyde,</p>
<p class="t0">That all the cytie so ryght long and wyde</p>
<p class="t0">May the beholde and the matter knowe,</p>
<p class="t0">For myne honestie, and thy shame, I trowe.</p>
<p class="t0">So there he hong tyll noone of the daye,</p>
<p class="t0">That every persone whiche went by the waye</p>
<p class="t0">Myght hym well se and also beholde,</p>
<p class="t0">And unto them the very cause she tolde.</p>
<p class="t0">Lo, howe with shame she her love rewarded.</p>
<p class="t0">His payne and sorowe she nothyng regarded;</p>
<p class="t0">Thus at the last he adowne was brought,</p>
<p class="t0">Replete with shame, it vayleth hym ryght nought.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus with great anger he his love confounded,</p>
<p class="t0">Healyng the stroke whiche that she hath wounded.</p>
<p class="t0">And by his craft he in Rome did drenche</p>
<p class="t0">Every fyre for he left none to quenche,</p>
<p class="t0">And towarde Rome a great circuite aboute,</p>
<p class="t0">There was no fyre that was un-put-out.</p>

<p class="t0">Thus all the cytie upon her did wonder,</p>
<p class="t0">For perfite sorowe her harte was nere asunder;</p>
<p class="t0">And thus Vyrgyle, with crafty subtilnes,</p>
<p class="t0">Rewarded her falshode and doublenes.</p>
<p class="t0">All this I tell though that I be a fole,</p>
<p class="t0">To the, yong knight, for thou maist go to schole,</p>
<p class="t0">In tyme commyng of true love to learne.</p>
<p class="t0">Beware of that for thou canst not decerne</p>
<p class="t0">Thy ladies mynde: though that she speake the fayre,</p>
<p class="t0">Her harte is false, she wyll no truthe repayre.</p>
<p class="t0">Nay, quod I, they are not all disposed</p>

<p class="t0">Let not thy lady of thy harte be rother;</p>
<p class="t0">When thou art gone, she wyll sone have another.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus forth we rode tyll we sawe afarre</p>
<p class="t0">A royall tower as bryght as any starre,</p>
<p class="t0">To whiche we rode as fast as we myght.</p>
<p class="t0">When we came there, adowne my stede I lyght,</p>
<p class="t0">So dyd this Godfrey Gobilive also;</p>
<p class="t0">Into the temple after me gan go.</p>
<p class="t0">There sate dame Venus and Cupide her sonne,</p>
<p class="t0">Whiche had their parliament ryght newly begone.</p>
<p class="t0">To redresse lovers of their payne and wo,</p>
<p class="t0">Whiche in the temple did walke to and fro.</p>
<p class="t0">And every one his byll did present</p>
<p class="t0">Before Venus in her hyghe parliament.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p class="t0">The temple of her royall consistory</p>
<p class="t0">Was walled all about with yvory,</p>
<p class="t0">All of golde, like a place solacious,</p>
<p class="t0">The roufe was made of knottes curious.</p>
<p class="t0">I can nothing extende the goodlines</p>
<p class="t0">Of her temple, so much of ryches.</p>
<p class="t0">This Godfrey Gobilyve went lightly</p>
<p class="t0">Unto dame Sapience, the secretary,</p>
<p class="t0">That did him make this supplication</p>
<p class="t0">To the goddesse Venus with brevacion:</p>
<p class="t0">Redresse my payne of mortall heavines;</p>
<p class="t0">I did once woe an olde mayden ryche</p>
<p class="t0">A foule thefe, an olde wydred wiche.</p>
<p class="t0">Fayre mayde, I sayd, will ye me have?</p>
<p class="t0">Nay sir, so God me kepe and save!</p>
<p class="t0">For you are evill favoured and also ugly,</p>
<p class="t0">I am the worse to se your visnamy;</p>
<p class="t0">Yet was she fouler many an hundred folde</p>
<p class="t0">Then I my selfe, as ye may well beholde.</p>
<p class="t0">And therewithall he caused to depaynte</p>
<p class="t0">His face and hers, all under his complaynte.</p>
<p class="t0">And to Venus he made deliveraunce</p>
<p class="t0">Of his complaint by a short circumstaunce;</p>
<p class="t0">Whiche ryght anone, when she had it sene,</p>
<p class="t0">Began to laughe with all the courte I wene.</p>
<p class="t0">Lo here the fygures of them both certayne,</p>
<p class="t0">Judge whiche is best favoured of them twayne.</p>
<p class="t0">Thus Godfrey Gobilyve did make such a sporte,</p>
<p class="t0">That many lovers to hym did resorte;</p>
<p class="t0">When I sawe tyme I went to Sapience,</p>
<p class="t0">Shewyng to her with all my diligence</p>
<p class="t0">Howe that my hart by Venus was trapt,</p>
<p class="t0">With a snare of love so prively bewrapt;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p class="t0">And in her tower to have a dwellyng place,</p>
<p class="t0">I seke adventures to attayne her grace.</p>
<p class="t0">Her name, quod I, La Bell Pucell is,</p>
<p class="t0">Both east and west she is well knowen ywys:</p>
<p class="t0">And my name, La Graunde Amoure is called,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose harte with payne she all about hath walled</p>
<p class="t0">With her beautie, whiche dame Nature create,</p>
<p class="t0">Above all other in most hygh estate.</p>
<p class="t0">Well, sayde Sapience, I thinke in my mynde</p>
<p class="t0">Her love and favoure you shall attayne by kynde;</p>
<p class="t0">And I wyll drawe to you incontinent.</p>
<p class="t0">All your complaynt, as is convenient</p>
<p class="t0">Unto dame Venus, to se directly</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
